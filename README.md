## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the third simple layout challenge that I've completed with Frontend Mentor.  I am building more comfortability with my workflow.  I didn't use anything new with this 
challenge, but I was able to complete it in a shorter amount of time.

### Continued development

I have several more "Newbie" challenges to complete from Frontend Mentor.  I plan to continue honing my basic CSS and HTML skills working through them.
